<!-- title: Public Record -->

The public record is the Ombuds project. Within  conversations The public record is that space. (make references to research paper.

# Definition
The public record is comprised of all [bulletins](bulletin) and [endorsements](endorsement) within the longest valid block chain. 
Only records that have more than six confirmations are committed to the public record. 

# Background
*This section briefly describes a bitcoin full node and the longest valid block chain to provide context for the public record.*

A bitcoin full node is a computer running . Every full node “download[s] every block and transaction and check[s] them against Bitcoin's core consensus rules” (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node). Each block has a reference to a previous block, and together, these many references between blocks form the block chain.

To operate faithfully and maintain , a bitcoin full node must:
- maintain an honest connection to the bitcoin network [to ensure it receives all data broadcast]
- possess a copy of the consensus rules [to validate the data it receives]

Key among the consensus rules is the “proof-of-work”. 

Thus, all full nodes receive the same data, validates them against the same consensus rules, and advertises . These combined factors result in every bitcoin full node maintaining the exact same longest valid block chain.

# Derivation from a block chain
A public record is derived entirely from a block chain. As a subset, the public record inherits the the guarantees a block chain provides, namely the aforementioned redundancy and data integrity.
*maybe have a list of guarantees hear that correspond to Habermas’ public sphere qualities*

# Implication
The Ombuds project translates these guarantees to written speech. Authors are, effectively, guaranteed their writing will never be modified or deleted. Together these voices within the public record can serve as a social history and provide a space for honest and independent thinking. Such a concept is akin to Jurgen Habermas

# Forgotten or Orphaned Records
Once a record is contained within the block chain and five valid blocks follow, the record is considered securely within the public record. However, 

Bulletins and endorsements that were not included in a block
Bulletins and endorsements that were orphaned

# Versioning
The Ombuds protocol was purposefully designed with simplicity: authors create bulletins and authors endorse bulletins.

### Status of This Document

While this is not an RFC, the intention behind this document is to describe the system completely so that it is reproducible and well understood.
Please note this is a **draft of a design** that is subject to change.

## Eventually Consistent

One of the goals of the Ombuds project is to build and record social history.
To ensure that nodes agree to the state of the public record, **only records that have more than six confirmations are committed to the record.**
This means that bulletins that are generated by a user and not mined are **left out of the public record.**
It also means that every full node that is constructing the record from the Bitcoin block chain has **the exact same public record**.

Full relays can inform clients of unconfirmed and recently mined record. 
A relay just cannot claim that the record is in the official public record.
By enforcing this constrait on what can go into the public record, we are able to assert that any full node is reconstructing a well-defined, globally consistent history of immutable messages.
This additionally means that to full nodes that have the same chain tip can assert that two their copies of the public record are identical.

The reason that the record is generated six blocks back from the chain tip is so that, with high confidence a user can assert that their message is stored permanently in that record.

### Unique State

By enforcing the depth requirements the all nodes even if they have an uncertain chain tip, will have the same public record.

##Versioning

V1<--V2<--V3<-- Latest version supports old message formats.

Should be backwards compatible, but basically a hard fork.
