<h2>Endorsement Specification // DRAFT</h2>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>An endorsement is a type of record that can be encododed in a Bitcoin transaction.
The goal of an endorsement is to provide a low cost, permanent way for organizations and individuals to publicly signal to the network that bulletin satisfies their criterea for endorsement. 
By providing an open mechanism for people to express approval of specific bulletins, more meaningful interactions can occur through Ombuds.</p>
<p>An example of this would be auditing a system that produces backups of politically sensitive tweets.
Multiple third parties could automatically validate that a tweet was accurately stored in the public record as a bulletin and endorse that bulletin.
This would provide a strong layer of audits that established that a tweet was created on Twitter at some point in the past.</p>
<p>Another use case is the aggregation of quality sources and material by news agencies interested in collecting digital ground truth.</p>
<p>What an endorsement really means is defined by the creator of the endorsement. 
Webster's dictionary gives us three definitions of the word 'endorsement'. </p>
<pre><code>Endorsment (noun)
: a public or official statement of support or approval

: the act of publicly saying that you like or use a product or service 
in exchange for money

: the act or result of writing your name on the back of a check
</code></pre>
<p>All of the definitions or none of them can apply to an endoresment stored in the public record.</p>
<h2>Status of This Document</h2>
<p>While this is not an RFC, the intention behind this document is to describe the system completely so that it is reproducible and well understood.
Please note this is a <strong>draft of a design</strong> that is subject to change. 
Do not rely the content of this document for any important decisions.
It has not been reviewed.</p>

<h1>Creating a Web of Trust</h1>
<p>Bitcoin-OTC. Defines how people get from one trusted person to another.</p>
<p>Chains of trust gives us insight into a graph.
The current model only gives us one directed edge.</p>
<pre><code>Reporter A                Voice OA

    bulletin 1  &lt;----  endorsements
</code></pre>
<p>This results only in the following structure.</p>
<pre><code>Reporter A

    bulletin 1  &lt;----  VoA
                       HWR
                       AmI
    bulletin 2  &lt;----  Glenn
                       HWR

    bulletin 3  &lt;----  Glenn
</code></pre>
<p>This means that Reporter A cannot transfer his legitmacy to another person.</p>
<pre><code>Reporter B      | 
                |                         
    bulletin 1  | &lt;--- Reporter A &lt;--- VoA
                |                      AmI 
                |                      HWR


Person C          Reporter B       Institutions

                   bltn 1B&lt;---------- Voa
                             \_______ HWR
                             \_______ AmI

    bltn 1C &lt;---- Endorses
</code></pre>
<p>An external reader just looks at the institutions at the edge of this network.
That reader uses those orgs as my hook into believing some of the content.
They cannot get deeper into the web without making a jump from trusting a bulletin to trusting the author of the bulletin.
These are two very different things.</p>
<p>Want a tool to analytically tell them who in the graph they should trust.</p>
<p>Open questons: 
- Can a meaningful web be constructed with the design as is?
- What web can be constructed from the existing setup?
- What are the small tweaks that are needed to make a better WoT?              </p>
<h1>Wire Protocol Schema</h1>
<p>An endorsement is defined as a Bitcoin transaction that contains the following protocol buffer in a series of data carrying outputs.</p>
<pre><code>message WireEndorsment {
    required bytes bid          = 1; // A 32 byte SHA hash of the referenced bulletin's txid
    required int64 timestamp    = 2; // Seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970
}
</code></pre>
<p>This buffer is encoded according to version 1.5.1 of Google's protocol buffer specification.
It is prefixed with the 4 byte indicator that informs parsers that the following bytes are an Ombuds record.
An example of the total payload encoded in hex follows this format:</p>
<pre><code>                  head |        protocol buffer   |
payload byte[] := 0xBEEF843F6724A347297987CD232304D
                         |        txid          | ts
</code></pre>
<p>An endorsement can either be encoded in transactions in several ways.
Parsers will look in the valid encoding formats as described in <a href="DD1">section 2.7.3 data encoding formats of DD01</a>.
Since endorsements are less than 40 bytes in size, the reference implementation will place endorsements in OP_RETURN outputs.</p>
<h1>Public Record Schema</h1>
<p>An endorsement will be stored in the public record alongside bulletins by full nodes maintaining copies of the public record.
The SQL schema is the same as the protocol buffer format except for one notable addition.
An author field is included which is the Bitcoin address of the transactions first signing input as described in <a href="DD01">section 1.4 author key formats of DD01</a></p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE endorsements (
    txid        TEXT, -- the enclosing transactions SHA hash
    bid         TEXT, -- the endorsed bulletins SHA hash
    timestamp   INT,  -- Unix time
    author      TEXT, -- formatted as a bitcoin address.

    FORIEGN KEY(bid) REFERENCES bulletins(txid),
    PRIMARY KEY(txid)
);
</code></pre>

<h1>JSON Schema</h1>
<p>The JSON schema of an endorsement follows the same conventions laid out by the JSON format for bulletins.
An example endorsement returned by a JSON API looks like this. 
Be aware that the fields are specified in the <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombudslib">ombudslib</a> package definitively.</p>
<pre><code>{
    txid:      "c9be2cbeb2da2dfe1f0158246938a3899f4e5c5108ea54e75c7c4f22580e42bc",
    bid:       "17756d6259242add26f728b8feb8f4b83a8c5af39d923b65f5ab6c0b27223d14",
    author:    "mkzkHkLn1Q5fRuNh2wbg3V7BjX4cKXQHYE",
    timestamp: 1444074578
}
