<h1>Overview</h1>
<h1>Eventually Consistent</h1>
<p>One of the goals of the Ombuds project is to build and record social history.
To ensure that nodes agree to the state of the public record, <strong>only records that have more than six confirmations are committed to the record.</strong>
This means that bulletins that are generated by a user and not mined are <strong>left out of the public record.</strong>
It also means that every full node that is constructing the record from the Bitcoin block chain has <strong>the exact same public record</strong>.</p>
<p>Full relays can inform clients of unconfirmed and recently mined record. 
They just cannot claim that the record is in the official public record.
By enforcing this constrait on what can go into the public record, we are able to assert that any full node is reconstructing a well-defined, globally consistent history of immutable messages.
This additionally means that to full nodes that have the same chain tip can assert that two their copies of the public record are identical.</p>
<p>The reason that the record is generated six blocks back from the chain tip is so that, with high confidence a user can assert that their message is stored permanently in that record.</p>
<h1>Versioning</h1>
<p>V1&lt;--V2&lt;--V3&lt;-- Latest version supports old message formats.</p>
<p>(It doesn't have to use them.)</p>
<p>Should be backwards compatible, but basically a hard fork.</p>
